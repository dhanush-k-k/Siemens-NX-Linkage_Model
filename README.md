# Linkage Model Siemens NX - Testing Design Intent and Extent of Design Iterations 

### _Developer_

Dhanush Kumar

## _Objective_
Part 1A- Creating a Linkage model as per specifications and establish a proper design intent which is the main motive of the project.
Part 1B- Creating multiple iterations of the model in Siemens NX to satisfy the critical dimensional changes and applying suitable changes for the model

## _Development_
* Tool: SIEMENS NX 2022

## _Dependencies_
The project requires any one of the CAD Modelling softwares. 
Suggested tools are Solidworks 2022 or Siemens NX 2022 for viewing the .prt model 

## _Results/Discussions_
* Modelling tools and strategies were used to identify the behaviour of part and apply a suitable design intent.
* Measures were taken to ensure sketches were constrained, simple operations were used for easy edits in future, comments were added to dimensions wherever necessary, 
expression table was generated to be further used in future.
* All of the design criteria were satisfied, and all adjustments were made without having to start over with a new model.
* Adhering to some fundamental design principles and keeping the number of operations reduced re-work.
